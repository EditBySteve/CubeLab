## Off-Plan / small fixes:
- Inverted Gravity Field now works better.
- Fixed and reverted lot of bugs

## Known bugs:
- When you Jump right before going on a Jump Pad, it sends you to low earth orbit

- Report the bugs you see!

## Other Info:
- The Speed and Yeet update will be split into two parts! The part 1 (v0.6.4) will be largely incomplete, but you can at least try out the new stuff, because part 2 (v0.6.5) will probably take a long time!
